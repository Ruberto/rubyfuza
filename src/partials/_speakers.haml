Between working with configuration management tools and orchestration frameworks, she has discovered there is a ruby community out there. Charlene has been trying to infiltrate it since then.  She is currently part of the ThoughtWorks team.
            %h3 Software Development in Africa
            %p Software development has gone through many upheavals and downhills to what it is currently. Still, it remains an impressive creation that is changing the lifestyles of many. Africa, on the other side, has a history that is yet to fully captivate many of its own people. So what could “software development” and “Africa” be doing in the same phrase?
            %p Being passionate about code and enjoying a love-hate relationship with my continent, I will share how these words resonate with me. I will discuss some of the achievements and also challenges of developing software in Africa, my fears and hopes too. Let’s have a conversation on what these words mean for us; software development and Africa put together.

He has also contributed extensively to many open-source projects including RefineryCMS and DataMapper.
            %h3 Find Simplicity With Plain Old Ruby Objects
            %p This talk will discuss why you might, when you set out to design a system, want to stop thinking about persistence. Rather than kicking off a project generating models that subclass ActiveRecord::Base, I will suggest beginning your application development by modelling behaviour with Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).
            %p While including ideas from Avdi Grimm's Objects on Rails, the talk will primarily be based around my personal experience refactoring an-ActiveResource based system with Plain Old Ruby Objects and roar.
            %p Included in this talk will be an exploration of:
            %ul.list
              %li patterns, such as Repository and Data Mapper, as coined by Martin Fowler,
              %li how upcoming libraries &eldash; Curator, DataMappify, ROM.rb and Veritas &eldash; fit in with these patterns,
              %li the parts of these libraries that are usable today,
              %li how to make this methodology workable in the context of TDD (keeping components as testable as possible).
            %p There will also be a discussion about the stage when you should begin implementing persistence.

            %h3 Extreme Makeover: Rubygems Edition
            %p Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries in the Ruby world. As amazing as that is, installing gems can be a time-consuming and even error-prone process. (Just ask the Travis guys.) In this talk, you'll learn about the recent dramatic changes in Rubygems and Bundler to improve speed and reliability by rewriting the Rubygems client/server architecture. I'll show how the new system caches more information, makes fewer requests, and takes less time to install gems. Finally, I'll cover how the changes allow worldwide mirrors of rubygems.org, improving things for Rubyists around the globe.

Forever changed by brief introduction to Rails I've spent the last 9 years honing my craft. I eventually found myself at thoughtbot where I currently spread the knowledge of Ruby to others by teaching workshops both online and in person.
            %h3 The Art of Ruby
            %p We should all be artists in our craft, but there is a balance between expressiveness and performance. This talk is about finding that balance and producing beautiful code that doesn't sacrifice syntax for speed. I'll explore real world examples of code and mold them into something far more expressive. During the process we'll take a look at how common design patterns are applied to larger applications and examine the repercussions.

            %p He studied Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, where he primarily spent his time trying to avoid writing C++. He got into Concurrent Sequential Processes before it became cool, and wrote a Ruby implementation called Minx for his bachelor thesis. As with all academic code, it is used by no one.
            %p He currently pumps out pull requests for a living at Zendesk, a San Francisco based Customer Support Software SaaS company.
            %h3 Curly — Refactoring the view layer
            %p While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. Though HAML has gained a lot of traction, it is not a fundamental shift away from ERB, but rather a preference for putting HTML in your Ruby rather than the other way around.
            %p More recent efforts in the realm of JavaScript have produced Mustache and its ambitious younger brother, Handlebars. While these are more radical in their attempt to separate structure and logic, they still do not feel like native Rails code.
            %p While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB. Though different only in subtle ways, it struck just the right balance between integration with Rails and separation of concerns. We called it Curly.
            %p I will show how we use the same old OO techniques that you already know to clean up our views, making them less prone to bugs, more readable, and more reusable.
            %p I’ll also show how a seemingly small change of our conceptual model enabled us to add advanced behavior to our view layer without ending with an unmaintainable mess.
            %p Curly is open source and available at http://github.com/zendesk/curly

After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.
            %h3 Analytics for the Busy Ruby Developer
            %p Our applications have the potential to produce a lot of data. Every time a user clicks a button, buys something, or our application does any number of things we have the opportunity to gain useful insights. But where do you begin? Should I gather every data point I can think of? What tools work the best? There is a lot of talk and hype about analytics. In this session, let's take a look at what goes into mining data and analyzing the insights. We'll discuss different approaches to gathering, storing, and querying data, how to determine the KPIs to focus on, and how to interpret and use information in meaningful ways. While you may not be a statistician, see how some basic statistics can help you to start to wrangle your data.

            %p This talk will teach you the value of open-source, the benefits of contributing, and a little bit about how ruby-core works. You will learn what to look for when spotting documentation bugs in the CRuby source code. We will cover the guidelines to writing CRuby documentation, and how to submit a patch.

            %p The first time I met objects was in Turbo Pascal in about 1990. I was completely baffled. I eventually got comfortable with objects in c++, and had that turned on its head by Smalltalk. Then Java objects came along and made me write too much code. Ruby was a breath of fresh air, but it took me 8 years before I really grokked the object model in Ruby. Lately with all the interest in functional languages, I've been glimpsing some overlaps between functions and objects.

            %p Ruby gives us a lot of freedom when expressing code and draws features from various paradigms, but it's an object oriented language at heart. In this session we'll go back to first principles of object oriented programming and see how applying object inheritance, polymorphism and a bit of discipline can translate into an understandable and maintainable codebase.

            %p I'm a fan of beautiful interfaces, usable and intuitive software. Software has such great potential to change the way that people live. Recently my love for AI and it's potential to solve some of the world's biggest problems is very quickly becoming my life long goal, to add value to peoples lives with the power of technology and software.
            %h3 The Birds &amp; The Bees
            %p An overview of computational intelligence (AI) paradigms focusing on their practical applications, the joy of programming in metaphors (birds, bees, ants etc). I'll introduce each paradigm in {neural networks, fuzzy systems, artificial immume systems, swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation} but focus on swarm intelligence and go through examples, like, simple data clustering using ants.

Now, well into its fourth year with a brand new, completely re-imagined technology stack, Cognician is providing value as a digital platform for self-coaching, performance support and much, much more.
            %p Robert has been coding for 15 years and is still not dead. Having worked in all facets of web development for a wide variety of use cases and people, he is happily astonished at how much fun he's still having, thanks in no small part to the Clojure language and its philosophy and community.
            %h3 Immutable Data...base?
            %p We’ll take a whirlwind tour through Clojure - the rapidly rising functional language on the JVM - and Datomic, a novel take on immutable databases. We’ll see how the notion of immutability makes life as a working programmer a lot easier in Clojure, and in Datomic, how it becomes possible to query the past, query against what-if databases, query across databases, and more.

            %p So what do we do now? We wear our gas masks, grab the refactoring cheat sheet, and get hands down dirty into the shittiest code we have written, and we clean it up. We keep cleaning till it smells of jasmines.
            %p And we come out with battle scars on our faces and a sense of accomplishment in our hearts.
