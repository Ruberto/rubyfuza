            %p The RailsBridge Workshop is a free one-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It aims to promote diversity in the software industry by providing an accessible starting point to those interested in coding. The course covers an introduction to programming concepts, the available tools, and Ruby and Rails development techniques. It teaches practical skills useful to those investigating new career paths, looking to compliment their current skill set, or simply interested in gaining a better understanding of software.

            %p Steve Barnett has a background in Maths and finance and started work as a Front End Developer in 2005, escaping to South Africa from his native England. He started at Unboxed Consulting in November 2012, and he’s most interested in the multi-device world and making the web accessible to all. You can find him at naga.co.za or on Twitter as @maxbarners.

            %h3 Software Development in Africa
            %p Software development has gone through many upheavals and downhills to what it is currently. Still, it remains an impressive creation that is changing the lifestyles of many. Africa, on the other side, has a history that is yet to fully captivate many of its own people. So what could “software development” and “Africa” be doing in the same phrase?
            %p Being passionate about code and enjoying a love-hate relationship with my continent, I will share how these words resonate with me. I will discuss some of the achievements and also challenges of developing software in Africa, my fears and hopes too. Let’s have a conversation on what these words mean for us; software development and Africa put together.

            %h2 An Introduction to Functional Programming for Ruby Developers
            %p There is a lot of buzz and hype around functional programming at the moment.  Many claiming it is the only way to scale and write safe code in our multi-core world.  Some of it is true and some of it is hype.  What I've learnt is that functional programming makes us better object oriented developers.  On more than one occasion, FP has offered us a cleaner, sweeter solutions to non-trivial problems.  In this workshop, we will give a hands-on introduction to the main themes of FP, cutting through the hype, favouring practice over theory.  We will play with a few languages like Clojure, Scala, JavaScript (yes!) and maybe Haskell or F# too.  So bring your laptop along and join in.

            %p
              Aslam Khan is a software developer for more years than South Africa is a democracy.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code as an expression of design. And the same goes for architecture too - it's all design.  The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very hard.  As developers we need thinking tools, and different paradigms gives us that diversity, hence his interest in functional programming.  He is currently writing a book on functional programming for Manning.  If that doesn't bore you, then try his blog at

            %p
              Ryan Lemmer is a Cape Town based software developer. He believes that achieving the "soft" in software is the hardest part, that is, to make code that is pliable enough to withstand relentless change. Functional Programming offers some powerful tools, techniques and perspectives, towards achieving "soft" code. Ryan loves learning and facilitating learning in others.
